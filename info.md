Milestone 1 wrap up
Your sample application can switch between two views when the user clicks a link.

Milestone 1 covered how to do the following:

Load the router library
Add a nav bar to the shell template with anchor tags, routerLink and routerLinkActive directives
Add a router-outlet to the shell template where views are displayed
Configure the router module with RouterModule.forRoot()
Set the router to compose HTML5 browser URLs
Handle invalid routes with a wildcard route
Navigate to the default route when the application launches with an empty path


Milestone 2: Routing module
This milestone shows you how to configure a special-purpose module called a Routing Module, which holds your application's routing configuration.

The Routing Module has several characteristics:

Separates routing concerns from other application concerns
Provides a module to replace or remove when testing the application
Provides a well-known location for routing service providers such as guards and resolvers
Does not declare components


Milestone 3: Heroes feature
This milestone covers the following:

Organizing the application and routes into feature areas using modules
Navigating imperatively from one component to another
Passing required and optional information in route parameters
